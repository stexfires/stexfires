stexfires - structured text file record stream
===============================================
A stream-based Java library to work with data from structured text files (CSV, Fixed width, INI, Properties, JSON, XML, ...).

The library is still under development.


Goals
-----
- expandable, adaptable, flexible
- elegant, short and fluent
- easy and simple to use


Motivation
----------
- Learning and using new "Java" techniques and functionalities
  - Functional Interfaces
  - Lambda Expressions
  - Streams
  - New classes and packages (Optional, Objects, java.time, ...)
  - Default methods
  - record classes
- Building a useful, free and open Java library (JAR)


Functionalities
---------------
- convert / transform (ETL)
  - **Input**: One or more files and their associated file specifications
  - **Output**: One or more files with other file specifications
  - split, merge, sort, filter, convert, pivot, ...
- generate
  - **Input**: File specification
  - File with random or rule-based values
  - Code
  - Documentation
- analyse
  - **Input**: File and associated file specification
  - Search a record or a field value
  - Statistical evaluations and calculations
  - Validate the content according the specification
- compare
  - **Input**: Two or more files and their associated file specifications
  - *It is unclear whether this is feasible and meaningful.*


File formats
------------
- Delimiter-separated values (CSV, TSV, ...)
- Fixed width
- Configuration files (INI, INF, CFG, URL, ...)
- Java properties (java.util.Properties and java.util.PropertyResourceBundle)
- JSON
- XML
- Optional
  - YAML
  - TOML
  - HTML DOM
  - Log files
  - Literature
- Ouput only
  - HTML
  - Markdown
